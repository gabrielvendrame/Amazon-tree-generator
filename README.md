# Amazon Tree Generator
## Introduction
This bot gets all the tons of categories from Amazon looking on all main links, sub Links and sub sub Links generating at the end a JSON file with all the tree (Almost 9000 rows!) Impossible to fetch by a human

## So who is this project for?
Commisioned for a friend that is currently working with Amazon FBA and other CEO stuff, he need this (I guess) to have a better understanding on how Amazon splits the categories and the products.
